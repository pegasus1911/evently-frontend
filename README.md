## ðŸ§­ Description

Evently is a simple, easy-to-use website where you can create events, share them with others, or join events hosted by other people. You can sign up, log in, add new events with a date and description, and see whoâ€™s attending. If youâ€™re the creator of an event, you can edit or delete it, while other users can only join or leave.
The website was built to practice full-stack development using the MERN stack, connecting a React frontend to a Node.js/Express backend, with MongoDB for data storage and JWT authentication to keep everything secure.
