## 🧭 Description

Evently is a simple, easy-to-use website where you can create events, share them with others, or join events hosted by other people. You can sign up, log in, add new events with a date and description, and see who’s attending. If you’re the creator of an event, you can edit or delete it, while other users can only join or leave.
The website was built to practice full-stack development using the MERN stack, connecting a React frontend to a Node.js/Express backend, with MongoDB for data storage and JWT authentication to keep everything secure.
